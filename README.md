# Pac-Man Clone (C# / Windows Forms)

A personal practice project: A small **Pac-Man clone** developed in **C# with Windows Forms**.

The goal was to playfully deepen my knowledge of **object-oriented programming**,
**GUI development with .NET**, and **game loop logic**.

## Features
- Classic 2D gameplay inspired by the original Pac-Man
- Keyboard controls
- Scoring system and collision detection
- Cleanly structured, object-oriented code

## Motivation
This project was created as a personal learning project to expand my C# knowledge
and gain practical experience with developing small games in Windows Forms.
